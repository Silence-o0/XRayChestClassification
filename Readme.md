# Disease Classification Model Comparison

This project compares different machine learning and deep learning models for multi-label disease classification on chest X-ray images. The main goal is to evaluate and analyze the performance of various models on the same dataset.


## Models

- **Random Forest**
- **Custom Simple CNN**
- **ResNet**
- **DenseNet**
- **EfficientNet**

## Dataset

The dataset is derived from the NIH Chest X-ray collection. Only five disease classes were selected for this project: Pneumonia, Effusion, Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pneumothorax, along with Normal images. The number of images per class was limited to a maximum of 4000.
